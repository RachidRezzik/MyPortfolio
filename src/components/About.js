            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>My name is Rachid Rezzik and I am currently 26 years old. I was born in Quebec, Canada and have spent the last 15 years of my life in Houston, Texas. I attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering.</p>
            <p>Life has since found me to discover the amazing world of web development and programming. It has always been in the family as my father and brother both program professionally, but I mistakenly never gave it the serious consideration it deserves. In recently giving it a shot, I have discovered serious enjoyment in the challenges and rewards of web development. My goal is to land my first job in web development and establish a fruitful career in which I reach my full potential professionally!</p>
            <h2 id="interest"><i>What Caused Me to Gain Interest in Development?</i></h2>
            <p>
                I was first exposed to the benefits of coding through the work of my boss in my last position as an Energy Analyst. His programming allowed him to build a company that brought valuable information to customers. In viewing what was possible with some hard work, I was determined to begin my own personal coding journey.</p>
            <p>
                I commenced learning python as it was the language I heard the most about. I learned some basic programming principles in variables, loops, and functions. I then found myself interested in learning data science to supplement my Analyst position. I spent the first half of 2020 practicing and studying data science. I completed several data science projects (can be found on my Github, link provided in footer), but unfortunately found myself losing passion for it.

            <p>
                I then luckily stumbled upon a Youtuber's video (Chris Sean) in which I found myself inspired by how web development completely turned his life around. His passion towards his career was very contagious and I found myself wanting to learn more about a possible career for myself.</p>
            <p>
                Following his advice, I immediately began watching and coding along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses (in that order) on Treehouse.com and Youtube. I made sure to make up personal mini-projects to test my newfound skills and build something new. I found myself having a lot of fun getting to be creative in a way I couldn't with data science! I've even grown frustrated at times that it took me this long to find web development, but it's better late than never!</p>
            <p>
                Eventually, I learned and practiced enough web development skills to build this portfolio website. Though I am proud of what I have been able to achieve so far, I know there's so much more I can learn to continue my progression and that's what truly excites me. In gaining my first Frontend Development job I can't wait to learn from other developers and become the best Frontend Developer I can be. I also see myself eventually learning and working on the Backend as well to one day become a Full-Stack Developer. I simply can't wait to take full advantage of the first opportunity I am handed!
